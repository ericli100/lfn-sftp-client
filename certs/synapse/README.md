### **id_rsa_synapse_prd_private.key**
This is the key that was generated by Lineage for the RSA keys used for SSH. These are not currently used at this time as Synapse has provided their own private keys to utilize in the connection. Use **synapse_lfn_prod_rsa_pem.key** instead.


### **id_rsa_synapse_uat_private.key**
This is the key that was generated by Lineage for the RSA keys used for SSH. These are not currently used at this time as Synapse has provided their own private keys to utilize in the connection. Use **synapse_lfn_uat_rsa_pem.key** instead.


### **lineage_pgp_private.key**
This is the pgp private key to decrypt received files and to sign files that we encrypt.


### **lineage_pgp_public.key**
This is the public pgp key that is passed on to partners for them to encrypt items that are to be provided to us and should be decrypted with **lineage_pgp_private.key.**


### **prd_passphrase.key**
This is the passphrase to decrypt and use **id_rsa_synapse_prd_private.key**


### **synapse_lfn_uat_rsa_pem.key**
This is the RSA key used to authenticate with the Synapse UAT environment

Username: **lfn**

```sftp -i synapese_lfn_uat_rsa_pem.key lfn@s-00cf6a49dae04eba8.server.transfer.us-west-2.amazonaws.com```


### **synapse_lfn_prod_rsa_pem.key**
This is the RSA key used to authenticate with the Synapse UAT environment

Username: **lfn**

```sftp -i synapse_lfn_prod_rsa_pem.key lfn@s-da0d661869a04283a.server.transfer.us-west-2.amazonaws.com```


### **synapse_pgp_public.key**
This is the public pgp key for synapse and is used to encrypt files destined for them. Sign the encrypted files with our private key **lineage_pgp_private.key.**

### **uat_passphrase.key**
This is the passphrase to decrypt and use **id_rsa_synapse_uat_private.key**
