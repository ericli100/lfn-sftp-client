# lfn-sftp-client v1.0.0 beta

There are two environment variables that are needed to process the WebHook notifications:

SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/...
MS_TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL=https://lineagefn.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/...

The application will error out with `Error: Incoming webhook URL is required`
